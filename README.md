# Pascack Pi-Oneers Scouting Server - 2020
Scouting server for FRC Robotics competition in 2020, game Infinite Recharge.

Features include:
- Visual game field as a part of form submission
- OAuth and user authorization
- Laravel backend and CRUD operations
- Formatted data tables and fields

Unfortunately, this is another project that suffered loss of original files, both due to losing the original computer the files were on and leaving the robotics team. As well, this project never came to fruition due to COVID-19 canceling most of the matches. I am currently working on recovering the files/examples from this project.

As well, note the `public` folder is missing, which is usually present in Laravel projects. This directory is used to actually "run" the project, and its disappearance is due to the nature of this project being hosted on GoDaddy, requiring the folder to be the only folder available in a certain folder accessible by the main domain, due to security issues. Unforunately, the folder may potentially be lost forever, and it contains important JS files that this project used.
